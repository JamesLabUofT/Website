## Biography

Nooshin holds a BSc in Industrial Engineering and an MSc in Geographical Information Technology, where she focused on wildfire dynamics in deciduous and coniferous forests using remote sensing. She completed her PhD in Environmental Science from the University of Alberta, with a research focus on forest dynamics and the structural complecity of forest ecosystems. She has been involved in projects utilizing remote sensing and GIS, with experience in airborne (ALS) and terrestrial (TLS) LiDAR technologies, and geospatial modeling. Nooshin has supported teaching in LiDAR remote sensing and GIS, with a focus on environmental applications, and has applied these tools across a range of topics including forest vulnerability, ecosystem function, forest structure, and wildfire analysis. As part of the James Lab, her current research explores wildfire science, LiDAR and fire behaviour modelling in boreal forests.
