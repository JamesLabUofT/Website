## Biography

Léo has a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics, and a MScF, both from the University of Toronto. He completed his MScF in the James Lab, where he was devising methods for analyzing fuel structure attributes from point clouds of forests collected using Terrestrial LiDAR Scanners. These new methods helped him investigate the impact of jack pine budworm outbreaks on fire behaviour in Ontario’s boreal forest. He stayed in the lab as a Research Associate, helping with the [WRFI lidar project](https://jameslabuoft.github.io/WRFILidar-website/). When not busy writing code, he is either cooking or thinking about the next thing he is going to cook.

## Education

-   **University of Toronto**<br /> Undergrad: Hon. BSc. in Computer Science and Mathematics
-   **University of Toronto**<br /> Master of Science in Forestry

## Role in the lab

When not simulating lidar, fires, or both, Léo likes to help his colleagues code, and enjoys taking care of the lab's computational server. If this website is out of date, it might be his fault!
