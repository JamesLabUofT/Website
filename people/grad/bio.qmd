## Biography

I am a statastician with a strong interest in enviromental applications, and was introduced to forestry through my summer job as a tree planter. I am currently studying harvested forest fuel structure and fire behaviour through LiDAR scanning and prescribed burns, to determine how harvesting can be utalized to mitigate wildfire risk.
