## Biography

Léo has a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics from the University of Toronto. He is currently working on his MScF in the James Lab, where he is devising methods for analyzing fuel structure attributes from point clouds of forests collected using Terrestrial LiDAR Scanners. These new methods will help him investigate the impact of jack pine budworm outbreaks on fire behaviour in Ontario’s boreal forest. When not busy writing code, he is either cooking or thinking about the next thing he is going to cook.


## Education

-   **University of Toronto**<br /> Undergrad: Hon. BSc. in Computer Science and Mathematics

## Role in the lab

Aside from working on his MScF, Léo likes to help his colleagues code, and enjoys taking care of the lab's computational server.
