## Biography

Jessica completed a BSc in Ecology & Evolutionary Biology and Biodiversity & Conservation Studies at the University of Toronto. Currently, she is working on her MScF thesis using a large-scale and long-term spruce budworm genetic dataset to quantify changes in genetic differentiation and effective population size over an outbreak cycle. Additionally, she is heavily involved in the Spongy Moth Genetic Project, a community outreach initiative to capture spongy moths across Ontario. When sheâ€™s not focused on outbreaking species, she can be found bartending downtown and playing sports with friends.
