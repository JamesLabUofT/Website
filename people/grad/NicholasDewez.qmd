## Biography

Nicholas has a a B.S. in Forestry from the University of Idaho and a M.S. in Biology from Texas A&M University Kingsville, preceeded by several years of practical field experience in the Rocky Mountains. Nicholas is curious about topics related to landscape-scale relationships between pattern and process in forest ecosystems. His work with the James Lab at U of T focuses on better understanding the mechanistic links between Spruce Budworm (*Choristoneura fumiferana*) defoliation and fire hazard. By leveraging big data and simulation modelling, he is looking to gain new insight into the implications of these linked effects for estimating burn probability under climate change. When not at his desk, Nicholas can be found riding his bike to the nearest auto show or exploring the trails Toronto has to offer.
