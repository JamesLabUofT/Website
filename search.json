    "text": "Outbreaks of forest insects are a significant agent of disturbance in Canada’s boreal and mixed-wood forests that affect forest landscape structure, including the accumulation of combustible fuels. As a result of repeated defoliation over consecutive years, defoliation by the spruce budworm (SBW; Choristoneura fumiferana) creates large patches of dead fir or spruce that have the potential to affect fire activity. Although it is generally believed that forest insects affect fire activity, how they have such an influence, and how this affect varies through time, remains equivocal. Expected northward expansion of multiple species of forest insect pest in combination with forecast climate-related increases in forest fire activity in the boreal forest means that there a a great deal of uncertainty regarding future disturbance interactions, their effects on forest composition and connectivity, and consequent ecosystem service provisioning.\nIn this research, we are seeking to better understand how historical defoliation by the spruce budworm affects fire risk including the probability of ignition, the probability of escape from initial control, and final fire size, in combination with multiple spatial and temporal covariates (e.g., weather and climate).\nRecently, we completed a project modelling the relationship between historical fire ignitions and defoliation in Ontario using a a series of generalized additive logistic regression models. Using these models we contrasted fire-defoliation relationships between spring and summer fire seasons, as well as between ecoregions in eastern and western Ontario. We found that, in general, spruce budworm activity increases the risk of ignition 8-10 years after defoliation occurred, but decreases this risk immediately following defoliation (&lt; 1 year).\nThe long term goal of this research is to produce predictive spatial models that can be used in combination with forecasted future climate and fire weather to predict changes in fire risk in response to changing forest landscapes and insect-induced changes to fuel structure and connectivity.\nStudents: Sophie Wilkinson, Franck Gandiaga, Kennedy Korkola, Clara Risk, Doriana Romualdi, Jack Goldman, Léo Jourdan\nCollaborators: Mike Wotton (UToronto), Jen Beverly (UAlberta), Laura Chasmer (ULeth), Jon Boucher (CFS)\nRecent publications\nFettig CJ, Runyon JB, Homicz CS, James PMA, Ulyshen MD.

    "text": "Population outbreaks affect spatial demographic variation which can influence population genetic inference. Current models that aim to understand the spatial, temporal, and landscape genetic dynamics of outbreaking populations risk making incorrect conclusions regarding landscape connectivity, dispersal capacity, and adaptation. The goal of this research theme is to characterize how demographic context affects neutral and adaptive population genetic patterns and to develop new approaches that take this context into account. This work primarily focuses on outbreaking forest insect pests such as the spruce budworm. However, long-lived species (e.g., turtles) also present novel demographic contexts that confound traditional approaches to population genetic inference.\nSpruce budworm\nThe spruce budworm (SBW; Choristoneura fumiferana) is a lepidopteran forest pest that devastates huge areas of spruce and fir forest during its periodic outbreaks. SBW outbreak dynamics are shaped by the complex interactions among climate, forest structure, communities of natural enemies, and dispersal. Despite the significance of movement to the spatial dynamics of SBW outbreaks, little is known about SBW dispersal, how it varies with spatial context and over course of an outbreak, and how it affects spatial synchrony in outbreak dynamics. This research applies tools and methods from spatial population genetics to characterize genetic connectivity among outbreak patches in the current outbreak in eastern north America. Using this information on genetic connectivity, and how it varies within and among years, we will infer patterns of gene flow and dispersal and how it varies as a function of intervening land-cover (isolation by resistance) and local environmental conditions (isolation by environment). Concurrently, we are developing dispersal models using predicted phenology (BioSIM) and demographic data collected from pheromone traps (adult males). Together, this work will increase our knowledge of how SBW movement varies in different forest and landscape contexts and will be used to improve simulation models that predict insect population dynamics and forecast future outbreak risk. This work will also address the important question of the potential efficacy of currently proposed early intervention strategies.\nCheck out our photo gallery illustrating our sampling network and developing results.\nStudents: JP Fontenelle, Morgane Henry\nCollaborators: Rob Johns (CFS, AFC), Brian Leung, Jeremy Larroque\nRecent Publications\nLarroque J, Wittische J, James PMA. 2022.

It all began with my Ph.D. studies at the University of Tehran in 2012, under the guidance of esteemed mentors Dan Simberloff, Reza Marvi-e-Mohadjer, and Lutz Eckstein. There, I delved deep into the intricacies of Oriental beech forest ecosystems, laying the foundation for my career in academia. Throughout my career spanning from 2006 to 2018, I have had the privilege of working in diverse forest ecosystems across the globe, including Mangrove, Sub-tropical, Arid, Mediterranean, and Temperate forests. However, it was in 2018, during my first visit to Boreal forests, that I experienced an undeniable connection with these remarkable ecosystems. Since then, my focus has shifted towards understanding historical ecology, dendrochronology, and fire ecology in the Canadian Boreal Forest."

She also leads field work in Northern Ontario in SBW and JPBW affected stands to better quantify these structural fuel changes with terrestrial LiDAR."

Our research explores the impacts of wildfire, insect disturbance and land-use on Canadian forest ecosystems in the current era of global change. We investigate these important problems through the application of a range of novel, quantitative, and data driven tools and methods.\nOur goal is to conduct research that has practical impacts for understanding the links between forest patterns and processes to better forecast the consequences of land-use and global change on forest health. We collaborate with government agencies, private stakeholders, and communities to generate new knowledge and meaningful impacts necessary for conserving forest ecosystem structure and function."

    "text": "SBW larvae and moths were collected across Quebec and New Brunswick, Canada as well as Vermont and Maine USA between 2012 and 2015. The following maps illustrate when and where samples were collected.\n\n\n\nAll locations sampled between 2012 and 2015. Many sites were sampled successively over all years, whereas others were sampled for only a single year. See legend for details on colour coding of each site. Also, each site may contain either larvae, moths, or a combination of the two. Many sites in the Cote Nord region were collected for larvae as well as moths at multiple times during the summer. The goal of this repeated sampling was to try to collect moths outside of their predicted phenological window (based on BIOSIM). Moths captured early or late relative to phenological prediction are labelled as putative migrants. Currently we are using genotyping (GBS) to test these phenologically-based hypotheses and to identify the most likely source of these migrants.\n\n\n\n\n\nSites sampled in 2012. This was our first year of sampling and we focused specifically on the developing outbreak patch in the Cote Nord Region (see inset, top left). Additional sites (labelled “LL”) have been contributed by collaborators Lisa Lumley (RAM, Alberta) and Michel Cusson (NRCan, CFS, Quebec).\n\n\n\n\n\nSites sampled in 2013.\n\n\n\n\n\nSites sampled in 2014 including moths provided by the CFS (CFL, AFC) and the Maine Forest Service.\n\n\n\n\n\nSites sampled in 2015."
